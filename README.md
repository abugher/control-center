If you wish to use an ansible role or other asset in this collection, you should download some or all of this top-level "control center".  To get all of it, use these commands:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/abugher/control_center.git
    cd control_center

If you are a contributor, prepare an instance of the repo like so:

    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:abugher/control_center.git
    cd control_center

I have attempted to deal with the complexity of managing nested subprojects with a program named *g*, available in the *git-automation* repository:
